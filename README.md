A program for generating stats on EO breaking solutions to DR and how they could be used for Rubik's Cube fewest moves solving.

It is already widely known that Domino Reduction can be used to solve a Rubik's Cube in few moves. Current methods usually use EO as the first step to get to DR because it allows for convenient recognition and setup to known cases. However FMC solvers are looking for different paths to DR to perhaps find solutions that are not achievable with current techniques.

This program aims at measuring how often DR can be achieved using reduction to triggers that do not preserve EO, such as R F, R U F or R U2 F in a short amount of moves.
